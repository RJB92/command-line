the wc command stands for word count and will give you the word, line, and character count of any text file
wc 'textfile.txt"
would give you the word character and line count for textfile.txt

you can use a pipe to redirect the output from wc to another command

grep Binary *.txt | wc -l 
would list all the text files that contain the word binary
the | would redirect the output to wc -l and output the amount of files that contain the word binary
